## Overview

This project is a web application for displaying and filtering product information. It consists of multiple HTML files, JavaScript scripts, and a CSS stylesheet. The main functionality includes fetching product data from a JSON API, displaying products in a table, allowing users to filter products by category, and viewing detailed information about a selected product.

### 2. style.css

The CSS stylesheet that defines the styling for various elements in the application, including the product table, list elements, and modal.

### 3. main.js

The main JavaScript file responsible for fetching product data from the API, creating table rows, and handling user interactions such as filtering products and navigating to the product details page.

### 4. product-info.js

JavaScript file specific to the product details page. It retrieves selected product information from local storage and displays it on the page, including the product title, price, discount, category, stock, and a gallery of images.

### 5. product-details.html

## Styling

The application includes a clean and responsive design with a background image. List elements, table rows, and modal elements have consistent styling for a seamless user experience. The product table features hover effects, and product images have a smooth zoom-in effect.
